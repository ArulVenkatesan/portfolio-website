 Portfolio Website

This project is a simple, two-page personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS basics. It includes:

Main Page – Showcases my introduction, skills, and featured projects

Contact Page – Contains a clean, responsive form to get in touch with me

During the development of this project, I learned and applied the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology to structure my HTML and CSS. Using BEM helped me write more organized, modular, and maintainable code by following a consistent naming convention throughout the layout.
